## Connect your domain

1. In the Pages project → **Custom domains** → **Set up a custom domain**.
2. Enter `wordfallgame.app`.
3. Cloudflare auto-creates the DNS records if `wordfallgame.app` is on Cloudflare DNS. If it's not, follow the manual CNAME instructions Cloudflare shows.

   - https://wordfallgame.app → landing page

   - https://wordfallgame.app/terms → Terms of Service
   - https://wordfallgame.app/support → Support
   - https://wordfallgame.app/.well-known/assetlinks.json → JSON (still has placeholder)

## Before you ship

- [x] ~~Replace `[Entity name]`~~ — set to **Iridescent Games**.
- [x] ~~Replace `[Effective date]`~~ — set to **April 16, 2026**.
- [x] ~~Replace `[Jurisdiction]`~~ — set to **the State of New York, USA**.
- [x] ~~Replace `[City, State]`~~ — set to **New York, New York**.
- [ ] **Have a lawyer skim the Terms of Service.** The template covers the standard ground but isn't legal advice.
- [ ] **Get the SHA-256 cert fingerprint** from Play Console (App integrity → App signing) once you've uploaded your first AAB, then **edit `.well-known/assetlinks.json`** to replace `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PLAY_APP_SIGNING_SHA256` with the real value.
- [ ] **Verify assetlinks** at https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/tools/generator — paste `wordfallgame.app` as the website and confirm "Statement list is valid".
- [ ] **Stand up `info@iridescent-games.com`** and confirm test emails arrive. Google sometimes sends a test email during Play review.

## Optional polish

- Add a `favicon.png` (32×32 or 64×64) and `apple-touch-icon.png` (180×180) to the repo root.
- Add an Open Graph image at `/og.png` (1200×630) and reference it in `index.html`'s `<meta property="og:image">`.
- Add a Google Play badge image to the landing page once the app is live.
